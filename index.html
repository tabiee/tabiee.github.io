							<p style="margin-top: -50px;">Stellar Stables is a 2D casual point-and-click adventure about collecting alien horses. 
								You navigate the world through interactive elements on the map, 
								solve puzzles and play minigames to get all the horses on the alien planet you are stationed in.</p>
								<p>This game was made by a team of six students, the development lasted 3.5 months and the game was released on Steam by the end. <br/>
									I was involved primarily in Programming and Art, while also sharing the role of the Product Owner, additionally I supported testing for the game.

								<h2>Programming</h2>
							</header>

							<p>I was in charge of the main mechanics for the game, which involved clicking UI elements, interaction and inventory systems.
								 <br/>Additionally, I oversaw Steam intergration, helped with UI and made minor animations.</p>

								 <div style="text-align: left;">
								<h3>What I learned:</h3>
								<br/>
								<ul>
									<li>Making clear Inspector instructions for other people</li>
									<li>Asset code reading & rewriting</li>
									<li>Creating modular systems</li>
									<li>Custom Unity Editors</li>
									<li>Screen Spaces and UI structure</li>
									<li>Scene Management and persistent objects</li>
									<li>Basic Inventory structure</li>
									<li>Steam integration and achievements</li>
									<li>Making and uploading a Build on Steam</li>
									<li>Using Unity Animator in script</li>
									<li>Unity Buttons</li>
									<li>Click Events</li>
									<li>Flowcharts</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							
							
							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<h3>Biggest Take-aways:</h3>
								<br/>
								<b><h4>Divided Tasks</h4></b>
								<p>Me and another programmer on our team divided our tasks so that we did not overlap and could work without relying on each other too much. 
									It was effective to keep our workflow smooth. I found that to be a good approach.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<b><h4>Editing Assets</h4></b>
								<p>I went through three different inventory assets before finally settling on one that fit our project.
									The first was too complex for me to edit quickly and the second was much simpler but had terribly dirty code that was difficult to work with.
									Trying out assets took out about 2 weeks of development, but was worthwhile as a learning experience to not waste time with bad assets.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<b><h4>Instructions Are Great</h4></b>
								<p>Writing clear instructions in the Inspector for other people to understand was a great way to keep the project organized and easy to work with.
									It meant that I did not need to spend as much time explaining how the system works to our implementer and left valuable reminders for myself.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<b><h4>Flowcharts</h4></b>
								<p>While we did not end up using our flowchart much since mine and the other programmer's tasks were divided, it was a good way to visualize the game's structure.
									We could see where our systems overlapped and what gaps we need to fill. It was a good way to plan out the overall mechanics of the game.

								<h2>Art</h2>
							</header>

							<p>We had multiple artists on our team, I took care of creating the main backgrounds and interactable object sprites for the game.
								<br/>I collaborated with the other Product Owner to create a good kid-like palette and style.
							</p>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<h3>What I learned:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Making a clear color palette for object readibility</li>
									<li>Using color palette</li>
									<li>Balancing time-constraint and art priority</li>
									<li>Drafting detailed backgrounds</li>
									<li>Sprite animations</li>
									<li>Designing unique objects</li>
									<li>Unity Animator</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<h3>Biggest Take-aways:</h3>
								<br/>
								<b><h4>Art & Design Overlap</h4></b>
								<p>There was some difficulty creating the maps because I needed an overall game design to guide the drawing, 
									but the designer needed art from me to progress on the design. 
									The environments are pretty, though not well thought-out. 
									Now I know that it takes much more planning and collaboration to make a detailed scene.</p>
							</div>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<b><h4>Simplified Style</h4></b>
								<p>I typically put much more time and detail into my illustrations, 
									however I did not have time to finalize my drawings and resorted to making rough but pretty doodles.
									I especially enjoyed making the sprites, I think the style I went with for them turned out great.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<b><h4>Creative Rut</h4></b>
								<p>I have some previous experience doing art profesionally, which I quit because it turned out too stressful for me.
									I wanted to give it a shot again, but while I was happy to make art for most of the project,
									by the end I was tired of it and felt creatively exhausted.
									 It became clear to me that it's much harder for me to do art consistently for project unlike programming.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<b><h4>Too Much Art</h4></b>
								<p>At the beginning, I was not intending to have both the programmer and artist roles,
									but I was the only one able to create large backgrounds relatively quickly. 
									While the backgrounds did not take much time, 
									I underestimated the amount of sprites I would need to make. 
									I feel like now I know better the general limits of my artistic abilities and drive.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div style="text-align: left;">
								<b><h4>Color Palettes</h4></b>
								<p>I really enjoy color theory and I think I picked a decent color palette for the game.
									I found it difficult and entertaining to limit myself to a few color options, 
									as well as making sure they are unique across scenes and interactable objects.
								</p>

								<h2>Other Contributions</h2>
							</header>
							<br/>
							<h3>Product Owner</h3>
							<p>As a Product Owner, I did my best to guide the team and keep everyone on track.
								However since I was not the one with the original idea, 
								I kept the vision vague and listened closely to my the second product owner's opinions, 
								making sure that we communicated our ideas and if we disagreed, I would go with her ideas instead.
							</p>
							<p>From what I observed, the team trusted me the most for the direction of the game and often came to me for advice or an opinion.
								It took a lot of my time out of development to communicate with everyone which was frustrating, but it was valuable in the end.
								While I often end up in leadership roles accidentally, 
								I am starting to see I am alright at it and willing to take that responsibility and learn to be better.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>Our team ran into miscommunication and conflict which hurt team morale and brought a lot of stress to everyone.
								I took on the responsibility to solve the conflicts because I wanted the team to work together and to quickly move past the issues.
								I was able to resolve one of the conflicts, but I feel like I was the wrong person to handle the next one.
								How I approched it was not ideal, but I don't think I made it worse, the issue was settled in the end,
								 not smoothly and likely after too much time has passed, but I am glad I did what I could and have learned from the experience,
								 which will hopefully help me in the future should I run into a similar situation.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<h3>Testing</h3>
							<p>Another teammate was in charge of testing, with myself being support to him. 
								During times where he was unavailable, I handled testing and observed people playing our game, taking notes along the way. 
								The bugs that were found were tracked in Jira and fixed quickly and the rest of the feedback was discussed with the team.
								All feedback was gathered and displayed for the whole team to read through.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>
								I took care to think about accesibility in our puzzles, 
								though I did not have much time to dedicate to it since our puzzle design was fragmented. 
								I feel like design affects how testing is done and what feedback is taken in greatly, 
								since there was some feedback I disagreed with, despite the testers thinking it was a better solution.
							</p>
							<p>I wish I had more time to do testing, but with the roles I had and the pace of our project, the amount of testing we could do was limited.
								We took the feedback we received to heart, documented it and made changes accordingly where time would allow.
							 </p>

								<h2>Introspective</h2>
							</header>

							<p>The project began with me and a friend. I assisted her with her idea by proposing game mechanics and a possible aesthetic for the game.
								We went on to pitch the game and gathered a team. We did not have ideal teammates, but that did not bring down my optimism.
								<br/>Me and her ended up splitting the role of Product Owner, where I took the tech side and she took the art side.
								I found it to be a good way to work, although from the words of my teammates, it created some confusion on whose word to rely on.
								If our roles were better defined, I think the team would've had a clearer direction.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>In terms of my contribution, I learned a lot of what I was hoping to learn going into the project, 
								as well as many small things I did not expect to come in contact with. I kept an open mind on the outcome of the project,
								and while we did not achieve everything we set out to do, I am happy with the result and the experience I gained.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>This project highlighted my existing artistic skills and gave me confidence in them, 
								it feels good to have an additional skill in my back pocket. 
								I want to continue as a programmer and learn more, 
								while also having an art background to expand my skillset and give me insight into both the art and programming side of things.
							</p>
							<br/>
							<p>Aside from my main roles, I helped where I could, 
								such as making UI, design, managing Steam builds & integration and handling a part of testing.
								At the end of the day, this project was a valuable experience that gave me insight on working on team on a long-term goal.
								<br/>And our game is on Steam! Cool beans!
